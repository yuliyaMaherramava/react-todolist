# SPA - To Do 
The "To Do" Single Page Application is a project developed using several modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux-Thunk, React-Beautiful-DND, i18next, Axios, Formik, Yup, Reselect, and Typesafe-Actions.

React-Beautiful-DND is employed to implement drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to reorder tasks and lists effortlessly.

i18next, a localization framework, facilitates internationalization by providing multi-language support within the application. Users can switch between different languages, making the application accessible to a diverse user base.

Axios, a widely-used HTTP client, is integrated into the project to handle data fetching and API interactions. This enables seamless communication with the server and ensures efficient data retrieval and submission.

Formik and Yup libraries are utilized for form management and validation, simplifying the process of creating and validating forms within the application.

Reselect is employed to optimize data selection from the application's global state. It provides memoization and caching techniques, minimizing unnecessary re-computations and enhancing performance.

Finally, Typesafe-Actions is used to define type-safe action creators and reducers, ensuring robust type-checking and reducing potential runtime errors.
